Time Complexity : How much time algorithm needs with respect to input n
=> loop 0 up to n 
O(n) = n
dividing problem into middle => O(logn)
...


Space Complexty : How much memory algorithms needs with respect to input needs
=> lets say we are initializing array of size n
S(n) = n


O(c) = S(c) = O(1) = S(1)
