Inheritence: mechanism to allow class to inherit properties and behaviors of superclass
=> Reusability - Modularity - Polymorphism

Polymorphism: ability of objects to be treated as objects of one common type, achieved through overriding 
=>Simplicity - Abstraction - Flexibility

Abstraction: process of simplifying complex systems/obects by emphasizing essential features and ignoring implementations
=> Modularity - Reusability - Hiding Implementation Details

Encapsulation: bundling data and methods into classes. Works on Data Hiding concept where data has controlled access.
(By making all attributes private and not providing getters for mutable fields)
=> Data Protection - Reduced Dependency

Modularity: To what extent a system can be separated and then joined all together
