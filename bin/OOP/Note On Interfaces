Multiple implementation is allowed where we can implement colliding methods in one method normally

This can't be acheived between Classes since there is already implementation to such methods and user is not obligued to override them

Eample 1: Doesn't Work
public interface IA{
    default void show(){
        System.out.println("HI");
    }
}

public interface IB{
    default void show(){
        System.out.println("HI");
    }
}

This creates an error: Duplicate default methods named show with the parameters () and () are inherited from the types IB and IA
public class Impl implements IA, IB{
    
}

Example 2: Works just Fine

public interface IA{
    void show();
}
public interface IB{
    void show();
}

public class Impl implements IA, IB{
    @Override
    public void show() {
    }
}

SO, main problem is instance objs and methods !
