LinkedList = doubly linked list
ArrayDeque = resizable array 

Both:
O(1) for adding and removing from both ends



ArrayDeque when you need a double-ended queue and efficient insertion/removal at both ends. 

LinkedList when you require frequent insertion and removal at arbitrary positions within the list. 

Consider the specific requirements of your application to determine which implementation is more suitable.


I like LinkedLists more, due to its dynamic structure, no shifts, no resizing 
Yet it uses more memory


Insertion to LL at end takes O(n) !
