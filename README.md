# Java Reference Repository
To localize my Java knowledge, as well to serve as a refresher for anyone (including me!), this repository came to life.


### Language Basics
Here, you can have a look on fundamental concepts of the Java. It includes topics like variables, methods, conditionals, loops, recursion, string manipulation, I/O streams, exceptions, intro to multithreading, generics, regular expressions, and more. It also provides a comparison between C++ and Java.

### Data Structures
This section contains implementation, manipulation and traversals of different data structures. It covers topics like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and maps. It also provides insights into the differences between certain data structures, such as ArrayDeque vs LinkedList, and Lists vs Sets vs Maps.

---

### Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
The OOP section demonstrates concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, abstract classes and interfaces, and date and time manipulation. It also covers the four pillars of OOP from A -> Z.

---

### Algorithms
This section covers files related to various algorithmic techniques, such as brute force, divide and conquer, greedy algorithms, and sorting. It also includes related resources, such as an overview and discussions on space vs time complexity.
