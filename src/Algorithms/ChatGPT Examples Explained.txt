Algorithm 5: Fast and Slow Pointers Technique
Explanation: This technique involves using two pointers that move at different speeds to traverse a linked list or array. It is often used to detect cycles in a linked list or to find a middle element.

Code Explanation: The hasCycle method checks if a linked list has a cycle by using the fast and slow pointers. The fast pointer moves two steps at a time, while the slow pointer moves one step at a time. If the pointers meet, there is a cycle in the linked list.

Algorithm 7: Sliding Window Technique
Explanation: The sliding window technique involves maintaining a window of elements and sliding it through an array or string to solve specific problems, such as finding the maximum sum of a subarray or substring.

Code Explanation: The maxSubArraySum method finds the maximum sum of a subarray of length k in the nums array. It uses a sliding window approach to calculate the current sum and updates the maximum sum whenever the window size reaches k.

Algorithm 8: Cyclic Sort Technique
Explanation: Cyclic sort is a technique used to sort an array of numbers when the numbers are in a specific range. It involves placing each number in its correct position by iterating through the array.

Code Explanation: The cyclicSort method sorts the nums array using the cyclic sort technique. It swaps the current element with the element at its correct index until all elements are in their correct positions.

Algorithm 9: Subsets Technique
Explanation: The subsets technique is used to generate all possible subsets of a given set or array. It is commonly used with backtracking or recursion.

Code Explanation: The subsets method generates all subsets of the nums array by recursively adding and removing elements. It uses the generateSubsets helper method to generate subsets starting from a specific index.

Algorithm 11: Top K Elements Technique
Explanation: The top K elements technique involves finding the K largest or smallest elements from a collection of elements. It often uses data structures like heaps or priority queues for efficient retrieval.

Code Explanation: The findTopKElements method finds the top K elements from the nums array. It uses a min heap to store the K largest elements while maintaining the minimum element at the top. Once the heap size exceeds K, the smallest element is removed. The resulting elements are then reversed to get the top K elements in descending order.

Algorithm 12: Min Heaps and Max Heaps Technique
Explanation: Heaps are tree-like data structures that satisfy the heap property. Min heaps keep the minimum element at the top, while max heaps keep the maximum element at the top. They are often used in priority queues or for efficient management of elements with priority.
